python-template
========================

by Ben Ramsden.

python-template is a starter template file that helps you: 

* Follow the Pythonista style
* Parse some command line arguments â€“ usually an input file
* Enable logging (either file based, or to the console)

It is based on a [blog post written by Fitzgerald back in the day](http://fitzgeraldsteele.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/new-python-file-textmate-template/).


There are no installation instructions, this is just a template file.
